# Monopoly Board Game in Java

## Game Objective
Own as much land as possible and be the richest person.

### Game Components
The game is composed of 6 tokens, 16 Chance cards, 16 Community Chest cards, 32 Houses, 12 Hotels, 28 Title Deed cards, money and a gameboard with 40 spaces.
The actions of the Banker and rolling of the dice are automated.

### Preparation
1. Identify number of players.
2. Each player enters a name.
3. Each player chooses a token piece.
4. The Chance and Community Chest decks are shuffled.

## The Game
In each turn, every player:
1. Throws the pair of dice.
2. Moves the indicated number of spaces.
3. Chooses an action depending on the space they landed on.

### Go
Each time a player lands on or passes GO, the player receives $200 from the Bank.

### Buying Property 
Whenever a player lands on an unowned property, s/he may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. If a player does not wish to buy the property, the Bank sells it through auction to the highest bidder. Any player, including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price may bid. Bidding may start at any price.

### Paying Rent
When a player lands on a property that is owned by another player, the owner collects rent from the player in accordance with the list printed on its Title Deed card. 
The owner may charge double rent for unimproved properties if s/he own two properties from the same colour-group. 
Having houses and/or hotels on properties lead to even higher rents to be paid.

### Chance and Community Chest Cards
When a player lands on either of these spaces, s/he takes the top card from the deck indicated, follows the instructions and the card is then returned to the bottom of the deck. 
The “​Get Out of Jail Free”​  card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck.

### Income Tax
The player has to pay the Bank $200.

### Jail
A player can land in Jail when:
1. His/her token lands on the space marked ​"Go to Jail"​
2. S/he draws a card marked ​"Go to Jail"​
3. S/he throws doubles three times in succession

A player can get out of Jail by:
1. Throwing doubles on any of their next three turns, if s/he succeed in doing this, s/he can immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by the doubles thrown.
2. Using the ​"Get Out of Jail Free Card"​.
3. Purchasing the ​"Get Out of Jail Free Card"​ from another player and playing
it.
4. Paying a fine of $50 before s/he rolls the dice on either of his/her next two turns. If the player does not throw doubles by his/her third turn, s/he must pay the $50 fine. Then, s/he can get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by his/her throw.

Even though a player is in Jail s/he may buy and sell properties, houses and hotels and collect rent.

### Free Parking
A player landing on this space does not receive any money, property or reward of any kind.

### Houses
When a player owns all of the properties in a colour-group, they may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those properties. If you buy a house, you may put it on any of those properties. The next house you buy must be erected on one of the unimproved properties of this or any other complete colour-group you may own. The price you must pay the Bank for each house is shown on the Title Deed card for the property on which you erect the house. 

Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as many houses as your judgement and financial standing will allow. But you must build evenly. For example, you cannot build 3 Houses on one property if you have only one house on another property of that group. As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank.

### Hotels
When a player has 4 houses on each property of a complete colour-group, they may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it at any property of the colour-group. 
They return the 4 houses from that property to the Bank and pay the price for the hotel as shown on the Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on each property.

### Building Shortages
When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for another player to sell their houses to the Bank before building.

### Selling Properties
Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) can be sold to any player as a private transaction for any amount the owner can get. However, no property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that colour-group. 
Any buildings must be sold back to the bank before the owner can sell any property from that colour- group. Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank by the owner of the property at any time for half of the price that was paid.

### Bankruptcy
A player is declared bankrupt if s/he owes more than s/he can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If the debt is to another player, s/he must turn over to that player all that they have of value and retire from the game. 
In making this settlement, if they own houses or hotels, they must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one half the amount paid for them. This cash is given to the creditor. 
Should they owe the Bank more than they can pay (because of taxes or penalties), even by selling off buildings and mortgaging properties, they must turn over all assets to the Bank. 
In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all properties taken (except buildings). A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the game.

## End Of Game
The first player to go bankrupt retires from the game. However, when the second bankruptcy occurs, the game ends. Each remaining player then values his/her properties:
1. Cash on hand
2. Lots, utilities and railroads owned, at the price printed on the
board.
3. Houses, valued at purchase price.
4. Hotels, valued at purchase price including the value of the 4 houses turned in.
